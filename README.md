# Python ARP Spoof Detector

Python script which automatically scans a local workstation's ARP table and detects and logs possible ARP spoofing attacks. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# IMPORTANT: The code currently uploaded is very incomplete and the script is unfunctional. Will upload a completed, working version soon.

This course was part of my studies in the Cybersecurity Professional Bootcamp at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
